            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The Sweathish Horsemen turning faces about, diuerse times gaue fire. &amp; shot some of them dead, and so escaped from them, leaving one of their Captaines behind them, and an other of their Captaines fell with his Horse betvveene the planckes of the broken bridge, but notvvithstanding came of vvell. After this they powred out there foming vvrath vpon the rest of the poore Burgers, vvhome they found in the Houses, they nipt, and pincht them vvith pincers, &amp; Thumb-scrues, and tormented them vvith other inventions to make them confesse if they knewe of any thing that vvas hide, if they got it out of them, yet it vvould not serue their turnes, because others comming

            <p>In the end, vvhen there vvas nothing more to be found in

VVhen it increased, and vvith violence consumed all that stood in the vvaye, then heard vvee often times these Neronian vvords: See hovve brauely Pasevvalke burnes? VVhat a fine fire it makes? I neuer sawe such a stately fire in my life? A great part of the Tovvne vpon the seuenth of September, vvas burnt vvith many barnes full of corne.

This senor I say together vvith these desired Captaine Smallenberke, that they might haue audience by the Coronell Gotzen, to crave, and intreate him, that the Maries Church, and the Houses vvhich vvere then standing might be spared, and kept from fyring: but he vvould not harken vnto them, commaunding that fire should be put vnto them incontinent, rid also into the Tovvne himselfe, and vvhere it vvas not a fire, commaunded to set it on fire, yea some saye he set it on fire himselfe? Moreouer it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hovve that the Officers, Especially, the Lieutenant Coronell VVinsten to keepe it from fyring, interceeded, and requested this Coronell Goizen, not to doe it, offring him many thousand Rix dallers, to keepe the Tovvne from burning: but here turned them this Heroycall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvere, That he had svvorne too deepely, and therefore all must be burnt, and not a vvhite spared. After this Saint Maries church vvas set a fire, a very sumptuous building vvith many costly Ornaments in it, vvhen they had plundered
<pb facs="tcp:176334:8"/> it of all the Church Ornaments, as silver, and gold, and burnt all the carued vvorkes in it, that a vvhit of timber vvorke vvas not left.

A souldier being asked by a Captaine, vvhere he had got that habit, ansvvered hee had taken it from the Papes, here vpon the Captaine replyed, that he should also haue slayne the Pape, or the Preacher himselfe.</p>
            <p>In this furie, and cruell persecution, there vyere not onely many children burnt to ashes, vvhich their mothers had left lying in their Cradles, and beddes: but also the souldiers, tooke those vvhich vvere shot, and vvounded euen to the death, to burne and torment them. And such as offred to carrye, or convey any thing out of their Houses, those they cast into the fire and burnt them.
